These instructions are going to assume you have [Homebrew] installed.

First, you should install `rbenv`, which is a tool to let you have multiple versions
of Ruby installed on your computer, and to let you specify which version to use in a
given directory. Not only is this handy for Ruby development, but it lets you try making
local modifications to gems without screwing up your whole system. As someone
who doesn't normally program in Ruby, I find this especially helpful.

Next, install ruby version 3.3.5. macOS probably still ships with some 2.x version, but
the 2.x.x versions are past their end-of-life and are no longer supported. There are versions
of Ruby that are newer than 3.3.5, but I haven't tested using them so I don't know if they
introduce any new problems to this system.
